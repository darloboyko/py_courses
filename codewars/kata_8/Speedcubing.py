#Speedcubing is the hobby involving solving a variety of twisty puzzles, 
# the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible.
#In the majority of Speedcubing competitions, a Cuber solves a scrambled cube 5 times, 
# and their result is found by taking the average of the middle 3 solves (ie. the slowest and fastest times are disregarded, and an average is taken of the remaining times).
#In some competitions, the unlikely event of a tie situation is resolved by comparing 
# Cuber's fastest times.
#Write a function cube_times(times) that, given an array of floats times returns an array / tuple with the Cuber's result (to 2 decimal places) AND their fastest solve.
#For example:
#cube_times([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = (9.37, 7.6)
# Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.
#Note: times will always be a valid array of 5 positive floats (representing seconds)

def cube_times(times):
    rethalt = []
    times.pop(times.index(max(times)))
    min_el = min(times)
    times.pop(times.index(min(times)))
    rethalt.append(round(sum(times)/3, 2))
    rethalt.append(min_el)
    return tuple(rethalt)   

#def cube_times(times):
#   return (round((sum(times) - (min(times) + max(times)))/3 , 2), min(times))
